        <p>German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has announced his country will allow modern German-made tanks to backfill Soviet-era tanks sent from Greece to Ukraine.

            Berlin already has similar deals with a number of countries that have Soviet-era tanks, which can be used by Ukrainian soldiers straight away without training.
            
            So far, Germany has struck such deals with Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland.
            
            Germany is also training Ukrainian soldiers in Germany on modern heavy weapons, which will then be delivered to Ukraine.
            
            German ministers say Berlin is delivering a lot of weapons to Ukraine and dispute the impression abroad that Germany is not doing enough.
            
            But some ministers and leading politicians within the government accept deliveries are slower and more complicated than originally hoped.
            
            There is growing pressure in Germany for deliveries to be sped up, to be more transparent and better organised.</p>
